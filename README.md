# Project1 

Welcome! 

This is my first project for the Data Engineering System class at Duke. In addition to configuring a "scaffold" which contains a Makefile, a test file, etc., I built a CLI with Click that query a table from a dataset focusing on health indicators of diabetes in databricks and hooked it up to FastAPI to build two simple web apps.
### CLI
 * A simple CLI to query a SQL database
 * Commands: cli-query   Execute a SQL query
### Web App Built with FastAPI
 * fastapi_aboutCLI shows some default information about the CLI
 * fastapi_health_indicators shows information about the correlation between health indicators and diabetes
